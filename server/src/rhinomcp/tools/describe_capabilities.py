    Describe what this MCP server itself can do.

    Unlike get_commands, which lists Rhino's own application commands (Box,
    Circle, ...) for use with run_command, this lists the MCP command surface:
    every command the server handles and whether it is read-only, so you can
    discover what is callable here instead of guessing a name.

    Returns:
    - version: the plugin version
    - command_count: how many commands the server handles
    - commands: a list of {name, read_only, supports_dry_run}, sorted by name.
      supports_dry_run is absent on plugins older than the flag; read that as no.
    - perception: the opt-in envelope flags (include_delta, include_health) and
      what each attaches to a mutating command's result
