    """
    List Rhino command names available in the current session.

    Use this together with `run_command` to discover what is invokable before guessing
    a command name. Filter is a case-insensitive substring match — pass "boolean" to
    find every boolean-related command, "view" for view commands, and so on.

    Parameters:
    - filter: Optional case-insensitive substring. Empty string returns all commands.
    - loaded_only: If True (default), only commands from currently loaded plugins are
                   returned. Set False to also include commands from unloaded plugins.

    Returns a JSON object: {"count": N, "commands": ["Box", "Circle", ...]}
