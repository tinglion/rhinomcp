    Create a new object in the Rhino document.
    
    Parameters:
    - type: Object type ("POINT", "LINE", "POLYLINE", "CIRCLE", "ARC", "ELLIPSE", "CURVE", "BOX", "SPHERE", "CONE", "CYLINDER", "SURFACE"). For pipes, use the dedicated `pipe` tool.
    - name: Optional name for the object
    - color: Optional [r, g, b] color values (0-255) for the object
    - params: Type-specific parameters dictionary (see documentation for each type)
    - translation: Optional [x, y, z] translation vector
    - rotation: Optional [x, y, z] rotation in radians
    - scale: Optional [x, y, z] scale factors

    The params dictionary is type-specific.
    For POINT, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - x: x coordinate of the point
    - y: y coordinate of the point
    - z: z coordinate of the point

    For LINE, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - start: [x, y, z] start point of the line
    - end: [x, y, z] end point of the line

    For POLYLINE, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - points: List of [x, y, z] points that define the polyline

    For CIRCLE, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - center: [x, y, z] center point of the circle
    - radius: Radius of the circle

    For ARC, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - center: [x, y, z] center point of the arc
    - radius: Radius of the arc
    - angle: Angle of the arc in degrees

    For ELLIPSE, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - center: [x, y, z] center point of the ellipse
    - radius_x: Radius of the ellipse along X axis
    - radius_y: Radius of the ellipse along Y axis

    For CURVE, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - points: List of [x, y, z] control points that define the curve
    - degree: Degree of the curve (default is 3, if user asked for smoother curve, degree can be higher)
    If the curve is closed, the first and last points should be the same.

    For BOX, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - width: Width of the box along X axis of the object
    - length: Length of the box along Y axis of the object
    - height: Height of the box along Z axis of the object

    For SPHERE, the params dictionary should contain the following key:
    - radius: Radius of the sphere

    For CONE, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - radius: Radius of the cone
    - height: Height of the cone
    - cap: Boolean to indicate if the cone should be capped at the base, default is True

    For CYLINDER, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - radius: Radius of the cylinder
    - height: Height of the cylinder
    - cap: Boolean to indicate if the cylinder should be capped at the base, default is True

    For SURFACE, the params dictionary should contain the following keys:
    - count : ([number, number]) Tuple of two numbers defining number of points in the u,v directions
    - points: List of [x, y, z] points that define the surface
    - degree: ([number, number], optional) Degree of the surface (default is 3, if user asked for smoother surface, degree can be higher)
    - closed: ([bool, bool], optional) Two booleans defining if the surface is closed in the u,v directions
    
    Returns:
    A dict with success, id, name, type, message, plus bounding_box (the new
    object's axis-aligned extent) and, for curve-like types, geometry — each
    present only when the plugin reported it. Exceptions propagate as MCP tool errors.
    
    Examples of params:
    - POINT: {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}
    - LINE: {"start": [0, 0, 0], "end": [1, 1, 1]}
    - POLYLINE: {"points": [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]}
    - CIRCLE: {"center": [0, 0, 0], "radius": 1.0}
    - CURVE: {"points": [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]], "degree": 3}
    - BOX: {"width": 1.0, "length": 1.0, "height": 1.0}
    - SPHERE: {"radius": 1.0}
    - CONE: {"radius": 1.0, "height": 1.0, "cap": True}
    - CYLINDER: {"radius": 1.0, "height": 1.0, "cap": True}
    - SURFACE: {"count": (3, 3), "points": [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [0, 2, 0], [1, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0]], "degree": (3, 3), "closed": (False, False)}
